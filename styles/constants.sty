	\begin{titleblock}{About}{}{}{}
		\hspace{15pt} In {\color{sidetopsep}2012}, my journey in development began as I dabbled in scripting for \textit{GTA San Andreas} servers, specifically \textit{SA-MP} and then \textit{Multi Theft Auto}. This initial venture introduced me to the concept of {\color{sidetopsep}client-server architecture} and the {\color{sidetopsep}fundamentals of OOP}, using \textit{Lua metatables}.

		\hspace{15pt} However, it was in {\color{sidetopsep}2016} that I decided to hone my skills as a {\color{sidetopsep}Python developer}. Since then, I've been actively working with \textit{Python}, delving into its ecosystem and honing my expertise. I've not only become proficient in \textit{Python} but also explored various technologies that complement this versatile language.

		\hspace{15pt} Beyond \textit{Python}, I've extended my horizons by {\color{sidetopsep}contributing code to open-source projects} across different languages, including {\color{sidetopsep}C/C++}, {\color{sidetopsep}C\#}, and {\color{sidetopsep}Java}. Additionally, my journey as a \textit{Linux} user, which began in {\color{sidetopsep}2012}, has kept me closely connected to the evolving landscape of open-source technologies.

		\hspace{15pt} In essence, my career trajectory has evolved to encompass a deep-rooted passion for {\color{sidetopsep}Python} development and a keen interest in open-source communities.
